Test-problem
============

From the attached wireframe and JSON object, build a widget for selecting specific people from a list of users. Consider how to build this in a way that someone would be able to reuse your code for a similar widget on the same site.

Expectations:

• It should be simple to select and deselect all users

• Clicking anywhere on the user in the list should select its checkbox

• Pagination should work

• The list should be sorted alphabetically by name
